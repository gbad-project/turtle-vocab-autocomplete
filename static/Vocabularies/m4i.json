  "description": "Metadata4Ing defines classes and properties or reuses such classes and properties from other ontologies to describe research processes and research data management in NFDI4Ing. New concepts and properties are located in the namespace of Metadata4Ing. Metadata4Ing does not import complete ontologies for the sake of relevance, readability, understandability and usability by and for engineers. Instead, it tries to make re-use of existing identifiers for classes and properties by re-using all or a relevant subset of the axioms from the original ontology. These statements have been extracted in different ways, e.g. by using Protégé tools importing an ontology and copying axioms of relevant items to Metadata4Ing or by download from data services or raw files of ontologies and manual copypasting. In some cases there was a need to extend or modify the original set of statements about an entity, e.g. because labels and definitions were expressed with a different owl:AnnotationProperty than the rest of Metadata4Ing, or because a skos:preflabel or a skos:definition in any of the languages we would like to support was missing. Any editorial changes on elements from external ontologies are declared in Metadata4Ing by an annotation with skos:editorialNote at item-level. To get the original set of statements we encourage to visit the original namespace of the respective item. Metadata4Ing reuses elements from the following ontologies: - BIBO = Bibliographic Ontology - BIRO = Bibliographic Reference Ontology - DCAT = Data Catalog - DCTERMS = Dublin Core Terms - FOAF = Friend of a Friend - OWL = Web Ontology Language - PROV = Provenance Namespace - QUDT = Quantities, Units, Dimensions and Types - RDF = Resource Description Framework - RDFS = RDF Schema - SCHEMA = schema.org - SKOS = Simple Knowledge Organization System - SSN = Semantic Sensor Network Ontology - VANN = Vocabulary for Annotating vocabulary descriptions - XSD = XML Schema Definition - EMMO = European Materials and Modelling Ontology - BFO = Basic Formal Ontology - RO = Relation Ontology - PIMS-II = PIMS Interoperability Infrastructure - D-SI = Digital System of Units",
